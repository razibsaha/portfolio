            <p>I am a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of wisdom and also, coincidentally, a graphic designer and Illustrator. My school of thought is reliant on schooling my thought – thoroughly, regularly; keeping abreast of design, branding, advertising trends, and solutions.
    
            Being a graphic designer and illustrator for a long time, I believe any design/art should be easy to read, easy to remember but it has to be unique. Over the past few years, I'm trying to be more effective with my designs and artworks by keeping it modern, unique and simple.</p>
